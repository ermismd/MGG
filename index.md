# Development of a Cytoscape App for microbe-microbe association networks                                                           


## Summary

The Microbetag GUI is a graphical user interface for the [microbetag](https://github.com/hariszaf/microbetag) tool, which infers microbial interactions and increases the confidence level of co-occurrence networks edges through metabolic network analysis and data integration. The GUI provides an intuitive interface for users to input their data, configure parameters, and visualize results.

It will facilitate the visualization and exploration of annotated microbial networks generated by microbetag. The app will be modeled after the successful [scNetViz](https://github.com/RBVI/scNetViz).

In these GH-pages the progress of the development will be periodically updated.

* Set Up the Environment
* Created mock apps for training using OSGI services and Maven
* Communication with the Mentors

## Coding Period


### Week 1 & 2

1.  Forked scNetViz 
             - Renamed to MGG
2.  Created new Github pages to keep track of progress
3.  Refactored the app
4. Created 2 classes in the app (ImportFileTask.java and ImportFileTaskFactory)     
  - Load and read a csv/tsv in the app
  - [More Info](./another-page.html).
 

### Week 3 & 4

1. MGGManager.java: implemented a mock manager class. MGGManager will be a central hub that registers task factories and acts as an intermediary for variable passing.
2. ImportFileTask: Enhancements were made by adding annotations for tunable and incorporating menu actions.
3. JsonDisplayPanel: A new class was developed to display imported data tables like OTU/ASV.
   -- [More Info](./anotherpage2.html).

### Week 5 & 6

1. ImportFileTask: Further updated.
2. SendDataToServerTask: Created  class for the server interaction and data exchange.
3. SendDataToServerTaskFactory: A factory class  for  instantiation and management of SendDataToServerTask.
4. MGGManager: The class was updated to activate the task factory for SendDataToServerTask.
      -- [More Info](./anotherpage3.html).

### Week 7 & 8

1.  CreateNetworkTask: Created class that accepts the response table from the SendDataToServerTask and is responsible for parsing the table and constructing a network model based on it.
                       Additionally, the class generates a visual style for the nodes and edges of the network.    
2. CreateNetworkTaskFactory: A factory class for instantiation of the the CreateNetworkTask.
3. Code Refinement: All previously implemented classes have undergone revisions to improve their coherence and streamline their functionalities, thus enhancing the overall codebase quality.
