The Microbetag GUI is a graphical user interface for the microbetag tool, which infers microbial interactions and increases the confidence level of co-occurrence networks edges through metabolic network analysis and data integration. The GUI provides an intuitive interface for users to input their data, configure parameters, and visualize results.

It will facilitate the visualization and exploration of annotated microbial networks generated by microbetag. The app will be modeled after the successful scNetViz.

In these GH-pages the progress of the development will be periodically updated.
